# Beautiful icons for iOS devices
(also works on Android)

When a user decides to add a guild embed to his or her homescreen, it will use the TitanEmbeds icon instead of the current webpage view (which often looks ugly).
These icons are made to work with iOS, but they should also work on Android, since Android uses the code for Apple devices as a fallback.
