    would <strong>LOVE</strong> to embed their Discord server on webpages... but simply, there was no other options to do such thing!

<h3>About</h3>
<p>There was a time when Discord doesn't support embedding the chat on a webpage. One must go into
extreme measures to ensure that they do not break the Cross Origin policy that Discord client is
enforcing, which resulted in many very sad outcomes. Many users have also complained that the Discord's
built in widget does not include the chat itself. What is the point of embedding Discord without
chat?!</p>
<p>This is where <strong>Titan</strong> steps in. By inviting Titan bot into your server,
it acts like a proxy where it relays chat from your website embed to the Discord server. As
soon as you invite Titan to your server, you will be given a unique URL/iframe code to paste
directly onto your website.</p>
<p>It just doesn't ends here! Titan is jam packed with many features, such as guest users
as well as allowing Discord users to participate. Guest users will be treated similar to users without a role.
Discord users however will inherit their own permission abilities. The client itself is designed
with flexibility. It looks good in websites of all taste!</p>
<p>Please note that Titan is just a mere piece of code that runs alongside of Discord. <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">It is never
used to replace Discord itself</strong>. (that's what the mobile apps are for!)
It is used in conjunction for a quick and dirty Discord embed for websites. Some uses include forum shoutboxes,
etc.</p>
